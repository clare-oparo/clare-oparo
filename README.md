Hello! I’m Clare and my journey into tech began at Moringa School. I learned Full Stack Development after several enriching years in project management.

On the frontend, I'm probably building with JavaScript and React. On the backend, it's probably Python, Flask, and Django.

Beyond work, you’ll find me dabbling as a home chef, or leading my wellness communities—First Light, Team Bikini Body, and Skincerely Clare.
These platforms allow me to share my passion for well-being and connect with others who are on their own journeys of self-improvement.
